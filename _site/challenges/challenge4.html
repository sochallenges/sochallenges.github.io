      <p>To coincide with the end of the Science Olympiad season, this week, we will be having our final challenge–an epic one of course (have to go out with a bang)!</p>

<p>This challenge is pretty open ended, but I have set one theme: Disease Detectives. As all of you may have guessed, COVID-19 is the disease that the challenge title alludes to. For this challenge, you will create anything you want (no, not anything, read on for stipulations) that addresses COVID-19. The item you create however, will have to thematically follow one other Science Olympiad event, one of your choosing. Your submission will include <strong>your creation, as well as the name of the other Science Olympiad event you chose</strong>. This is a creativity challenge, and I certainly look forward to what is created!</p>

<p>In you still have no clue as to what you what to create, I have included some examples below, and as you can see, they range from technical to just plain awesome:</p>

<p><em>Examples:</em></p>

<p>Disease Detectives x Anatomy and Physiology: a report on the effects of COVID-19 on the human body<br />
Disease Detectives x Sounds of Music: a song about COVID-19<br />
Disease Detectives x Protein Modeling: a 3D model of the virus<br />
Disease Detectives x Food Science: COVID-19 cake</p>

<p>You get the idea! Submissions will be due by 5:00 PM on Sunday so we have to time review them. Winners and this week’s prize will be announced on Sunday at 9:00 PM.</p>
