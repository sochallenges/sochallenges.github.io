      <p>I have to admit, this week’s challenge was pretty tough. But not only were three of our members able to solve the challenge, two were able to do so on the same day the challenge was released! Before I announce the winners (OK, if you are impatient, you probably already scrolled down), I want to reveal the answers:</p>

<p><strong>Affine Cipher</strong>: Birds have hollow bones that help them fly.</p>

<p><strong>Aristocrat</strong>: The next cipher in this weekly challenge starts with the word what.</p>

<p><strong>Patristocrat</strong>: What are the occupation of Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson, and Lord Byron? (The answer is poet.)</p>

<p><strong>Hill Cipher</strong>: Oriole</p>

<hr />

<p>OK, now on to the winners:</p>

<p><strong>1st place</strong>: Serena Yeh</p>

<p><strong>2nd place</strong>: Sidhant Chaliha</p>

<p><strong>3rd place</strong>: Keshav Narang</p>

<p>Congratulations to our winners! Now, let’s find out what they’ve won. Is it a cruise? Or a giant check? Nope, better, our winners are going home with (or rather being sent) a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MYPZZ19/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A1C9GJC0E5I4EM&amp;psc=1">16 piece puzzle set</a> to help them pass the time and exercise their brains during quarantine. Very fitting to our theme, right?</p>

<p>Didn’t win this week? Not to worry. Our next challenge will be revealed this Tuesday at 4:15 PM, so stay tuned. In the meantime, check out the leaderboards or just marvel at the countdown clock until the release of the next challenge.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
