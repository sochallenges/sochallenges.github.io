        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
        <div id="qna">
            <b>How do these weekly challenges work?</b>
            <p>Every Tuesday at 4:15 PM, a new challenge will be posted under the "<a href="/challenges">Challenges</a>" section of the site. When you've completed the challenge, email Coach Irene with that week's submission requirements, and then just sit back and relax. On Sunday, winners and the week's mystery prize will be posted.</p>
            <b>What can I expect for these challenges?</b>
            <p>While the theme of each week's challenge will be based off of a Science Olympiad event, the rules may be as wacky as they come. You'll just have to stay tuned each week to find out!</p>
            <b>I thought of an idea for a challenge. Can I submit it and have it be featured as a weekly challenge?</b>
            <p>Definitely, we welcome your submissions. If you have an idea for a weekly challenge, write it up in the style of a challenge blog post (look at the past ones for reference), and you could have the chance for your challenge to be featured as the next weekly challenge. If you do, you will automatically win the week's mystery prize.</p>
            <b>How are the winners determined for each challenge?</b>
            <p>Some challenges are time-based while others may have different scoring criteria. We'll make sure to mention the type of challenge in the challenge post.</p>
            <b>When and how will I receive my prizes?</b>
            <p>Winners will be mailed their prizes, as we do not anticipate returning to school for the school year.</p>
            <b>I have more questions...</b>
            <p>Feel free to shoot Coach Irene an email with your question!</p>
