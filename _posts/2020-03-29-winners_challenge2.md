I was blown away by the creativity I saw this week! Some submissions had me laughing out loud while others had me admiring how accurate and technical they were. 

OK, enough talk, let's announce our winners:

**1st place**: Keshav Narang

**2nd place**: Ellie Xi

**3rd place**: Sidhant Chaliha

**4th place**: Samuel Liu

Congratulations to our winners! Now, let's find out this week's mystery prize. Obviously, I had to choose something on theme, so this week, our winners are getting a [Paper Mate mechanical pencil starter set](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001T6QCJC/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_6?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1) for all their writing needs!

Didn't win this week? Not to worry. Our next challenge will be revealed this Tuesday at 4:15 PM, so stay tuned. In the meantime, check out the leaderboards or just marvel at the countdown clock until the release of the next challenge.

Until next time!
