For this week's mashup challenge, we have a Write It Do It and Game On medley. That's right, we're bringing out our old "friend" Scratch.

For this challenge, you will watch the following video and try to recreate the story/game by piecing together blocks from Scratch (this is the Write It Do It element of this challenge). Then, you will come up with an ending for it, which should be around 5-10 seconds long (the Game On portion of the challenge). Your submission will include **a screenshot of the blocks you used** (or your source code if you can even call it that) and **a screen recording of the story/game in action**. This is an accuracy and creativity-based challenge, so the four submissions that recreate the original video most accurately and are most creative in their additions will be the winners. As stated, winners and this week's prize will be announced on Sunday at 9:00 PM. Can't wait to see what everyone comes up with!

**The Challenge**

Piece together Scratch blocks to recreate the story/game in this video:
<video width="640" height="360" controls autoplay>
    <source src="/assets/challenge2/scratch_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>
Then, create a 5-10 second ending for the story/game.

And that's it! Make sure to send in a screenshot of your work and a screen recording of your masterpiece.
