To kick off our weekly challenges, we'll start off with a Codebusters and Ornithology themed puzzle. Get ready, because this is going to be _egg-citing_! (No, I have no _egrets_ about that horrible pun.)

For this challenge, you will have to solve a series of ciphers (you may look up how to solve the cipher but may not plug in the cipher to an online cipher solver) to decode the name of a mystery bird. You must solve each cipher to completion. Your submission must include **your written work** and **an image of the mystery bird**. This is a speed challenge, so the first four correct submissions will be the winners. As stated, winners and this week's prize will be announced on Sunday at 9:00 PM. Good luck!

**The Challenge**

Let's start off with a fun fact about birds that needs to be decoded using an Affine Cipher where a=15 and b=2.

OK, now that you're warmed up, here's your first clue in the form of an aristocrat. Feel free to look up a frequency table if you would like.

Now, time to up the difficulty level. Solve this patristocrat, which will provide you with the keyword for the next cipher.

Here's the final challenge: a 2x2 Hill cipher that you will need to decode using the keyword you found from the previous challenge.

Here's an inverse table to help you.

Did you solve it? Make sure to send in your written work with the solutions to each cipher and an image of the mystery bird.
