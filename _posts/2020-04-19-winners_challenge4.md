This was the grand finale of Science Olympiad Challenges, and boy, did we get some grand submissions! I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed by the technical depth and creativity behind each submission, and ultimately, I decided to forgo ranked winners this week since it would be like comparing apples to oranges. Instead, I will be walking through each of the submitted projects (in the order that I received the submissions) and providing links to them, so you can see how amazing they are for yourself.

**Winners:**

**Samuel Liu** created a Rube Goldberg machine that dispenses hand sanitizer for Disease Detectives x Mission Possible. Talk about handy! Take a look:

In his mathematical analysis of COVID-19, a cross between Disease Detectives and Technical Problem Solving (a previous Div. C event involving data processing and problem solving), **Sidhant Chaliha** utilized differential equations and looked at an epidemic simulator to explain the benefits of social distancing. Give his report a read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mKeKQ4klW93uZnoeaeHv521opbwQXxXEoF9Q0rv7YII/edit?usp=sharing).

**Indeever Madireddy** combined Disease Detectives, Water Quality, and Experimental Design and looked at experimental data around the environmental impacts of the coronavirus. He made a powerpoint presentation explaining the decreased pollution caused by coronavirus, as well as proposing potential studies regarding aquatic organisms relating to coronavirus. You can check out these slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pi8KtUX5wSsYVyoK5AI6-oq_rcEbzlTHx2XOk4u3ZIo/edit?usp=sharing).

**Keshav Narang** wrote a report on the spread of COVID-19 inside the human body, detailing its effects on various parts of the body. He provides clear diagrams and helpful infographics regarding ways to "stop the spread" in his report, which can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P9_a5WuMpnh99gG15F6VDCY3_6wR7o5kiKC4wMFQFLQ/edit?usp=sharing).

Congratulations to our winners! They will be receiving [a scratch-off travel map poster and tools](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HW2SXP7/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A13BKP0UH2AYCJ&psc=1) to document their previous and future adventures (but none right now, of course!).

I hope that everyone enjoyed these challenges and the Science Olympiad season, albeit it ending in a very different way than expected. Stay safe!

Signing off!
